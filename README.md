# NWTornadoStats
Tornados and heavy thunderstorms racking the windows of my home brought to mind how the region's peak tornado season—March through May— is coming to a close. I sought out details on tornados for my region and found some interesting data to practice using maps in Tableau.

### Programs Used ###
- Excel
- Tableau

### Scope of Work ###
**Deliverables**
- A dashboard detailing 3 key metrics
      - Tornado Number
      - Injuries
      - Deaths
- A dashboard visualizing the data on a geographic map

### Data Source ###
For this project, the data was collected from TornadoPath. TornadoPath is a website that offers faster weather warnings through maintaining a direct connection to the National Weather Service. They also offer an archive of tornados themselves. I got a list of counties to be considered "North West Georgia" and researched them on TornadoPath's website. I created a dataset reflecting the result of that research.
   
### Goals ###
My ability to properly handle maps and navigate Tableau is a skill I'm still polishing. I have more ambitious projects and I took this opportunity to design a specific data visualization that is clean, navigatable, and understandable. My goals were to be more familar with filters and selecting different attributes to display on one map. 

### Data Opportunities ###
Areas I could have explored deeper with this data could be seasonality. Tornado Path offered detailed statistics on when each tornado occured. This could help confirm the suspected peak tornado season as well as identify some outliers. Also monetary damages as a result could have potentially indicated severity better than injuries (though if the tornado hit a mansion I guess that'd also skew it!). I also considered exploring the population of each county as that could affect the number of injuries/deaths. Heavily populated areas might demonstrate higher numbers. I decided to keep it simple though for the sake of practice. 

### Reflections ###
I learned a lot about parameters and calculated fields with this dashboard. [This video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDHiKOYluqQ) on multiple measure swapping by Data with Baraa was very helpful in connecting how parameters work and can be used to create interactive dashboards. I also enjoyed displaying data in such a transparent easy to read way. It felt very cohesive and I'm proud of that. I'm still unable to draw direct conclusions just based on visualizations alone, but its exciting being drawn into the data and seeing how things, at minimum, appear!
